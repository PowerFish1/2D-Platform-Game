# 2D-Platform-Game
In my prior endeavor, I developed a 3D platformer game, which proved to be more challenging due to the intricacies associated with three-dimensional design. Considering my commitment to delivering high-quality games, I sought a change in approach. As a result, I transitioned to creating a 2D game, which I have successfully completed. The decision to adopt a 2D format has enabled me to enhance clarity and optimize performance significantly. This undertaking has been instrumental in my personal growth as I have acquired valuable knowledge and skills throughout the process.
